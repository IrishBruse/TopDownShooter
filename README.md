# TopDownShooter

The first game i made in xna a few years ago ported to monogame  
its awful but a nice archieve of my oldest project  

## Keybinds

-   `WASD` to move the player around
-   `Arrow keys` to shoot in the directions
-   `F1` to close the application for what ever reason
-   `K` cheat to lower hp by 3
-   `L` cheat to reset hp back to 100
-   `Space` steps the simulation
-   `V` steps the simulation at 60 steps per
